This is a python file that you can simply run and it will ask you for your name that you need to type in to the terminal.
The program will then ask you to guess a number between 1 and 10, depending on what ytou type in to the terminal the program will tell you if the guess is too low or too high.
Once you've guessed correctly the program will tell you how many tries it took and then ask you if you want to try again.
if you choose to quit the program will ask you if you want to see highscores of guesses and print out a sorted list of the amount of guesses.
